# Medical Conversation Agent with LangGraph

This project implements a LangGraph-based conversational agent that simulates a medical consultation between a patient and doctor. The system uses two specialized subagents that interact in turns until the consultation is resolved.

- **Patient Agent**: Asks medical questions, describes symptoms, and seeks clarification
- **Multi Elyx Team Agent**: Provides medical advice, asks follow-up questions, and can mark consultations as resolved
- **LangGraph Orchestration**: Manages the conversation flow and turn-taking
- **Configurable**: Support for different LLM models and conversation parameters
- **Interactive & Batch Modes**: Run single conversations or test with multiple scenarios
